# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
Add features to the PlanMyTrip app to include weather descriptions, input statements to filter the data for weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, from the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route will be created between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
